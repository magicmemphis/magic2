			From the MAGIC President...
Welcome! Let's learn a bit about MAGIC...

			<br /><br />
			We often hear how GIS has been used by organizations to utilize resources, increase productivity, and even save lives. The uses are incredible and endless, yet what i find even more amazing is the adaptability of this technology. The same analysis technique can be used by totally different organizations in separate industries.

This is what makes the Memphis Area Geographic Information Council more than just a users group. MAGIC is an incredible resource for students, end-users and GIS professionals.Though our members work within different industries, the technology and ideas are very much transferable. Our mission is GIS advocacy in the form of sharing this technology and our experiences within the group and beyond.

I’m proud to be a member of this organization and I’m honored to serve as the 2014 president. As president, it is my goal to expand our student outreach within the STEM education coalition and 4-H organization.!

Please join us at one of our bi-monthly meetings and consider attending our conference in November.

Sincerely,
Justin Abart
2014 MAGIC President

			MAGIC meetings are open to the public and are announced on our event calendar.
